This is a scientific application that numerically approximates the solution to differential equationswith GSL.

-How to build:
 Run 'make'

Two executables are created in the make process: chargedParticleMotion and simpleODEmyRK4.

-simpleODEmyRK4 is my implementation of an RK4 solver and it solves the simple first order differential equation y'(x)=y(x) with the initial condition y(0)=1.

This program computes the numerical and analytical solution to the simple ODE and also prints the error to the standard output. The exact solution to the problem is y(x)=e^t. 

-chargedParticleMotion can solve both the simple first order ODE mentioned above and the charged particle motion equations: 

 x'=u
 y'=v
 z'=w
 u'=wv-u/tao
 v'=-wu-v/tao
 w'=-w/tao
 
 w=5, tao=5, initial conditions: x_0=(0,0,0) and v_0=(20,0,2)
 
with the third party library GSL.

Input parsing for chargedParticleMotion is done via the grvy library and it can be managed in the file input.dat, which is self-explanatory.

If input.dat is set to problem 2, running './chargedParticleMotion' produces output.dat which has theevolution of all 6 variables. To plot the trajectory, run the command 'gnuplot plotx.plt' to produce the eps file of the plot and view it with the command 'evince chargedParticleMotion.eps'.

-How to clean up:
 Run 'make clean' to delete all executables and files created.
